== Description ==

Renders for mobile visitors a mobile version of your WordPress site, with blazing-fast page loads, multiple themes, 
support for over 5000 mobile devices (not just iPhones and touch phones), analytics, ad network integration, 
and awesome support!

== Installation ==
1. Select `MobStac Mobile` from the Plugin directory in WordPress
1. Activate `MobStac Mobile` through the 'Plugins' menu page in WordPress Admin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have the WP Supercache plugin installed. Is MobStac compatible with it? =

Absolutely, MobStac is compatible and works well with the WP Super Cache plugin as well as others
such as W3 Total Cache. For best results, please configure your caching plugin to turn off caching
for mobile devices since that's handled by MobStac.
